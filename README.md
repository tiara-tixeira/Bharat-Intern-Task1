# Registration Form
Overview
This project involves developing a registration form that allows users to sign up and store their information using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB. The form captures user details and stores them in a MongoDB database for later retrieval and management.

Features
User Registration: Users can sign up by entering their information into the form.
Data Storage: User information is stored in a MongoDB database.
Validation: Basic validation to ensure that user input is correctly formatted.
Styling: The form is styled using CSS for a better user experience.
Technologies Used
HTML: For creating the structure of the registration form.
CSS: For styling and enhancing the visual appearance of the form.
Node.js: For handling server-side logic and interactions with the MongoDB database.
MongoDB: For storing user information in a NoSQL database.
How It Works
User Input: Users fill out the registration form with their details (e.g., name, email, password).
Form Submission: Upon submission, the form data is sent to a Node.js server.
Data Handling: The server processes the data and stores it in a MongoDB database.
Confirmation: Users receive a confirmation message upon successful registration.
